# Grafana: An Introduction

![Grafana Logo](https://grafana.com/static/assets/img/grafana_logo_wordmark_horizontal-dark-background.svg)

Welcome to Grafana! If you need to understand, query, visualize, and alert on your metrics no matter where they are stored, this guide is for you. It provides a comprehensive overview of what Grafana is, its core philosophy, and why it has become the open-source standard for observability dashboards.

## What is Grafana?

**Grafana is an open-source analytics and interactive visualization web application.** It allows you to create, explore, and share beautiful dashboards with your team.

The key thing to understand about Grafana is that it does **not** store any data itself. Instead, it is a powerful visualization layer that connects to many different data sources. You point Grafana at your data's location, and it provides the tools to turn that raw data into elegant graphs, charts, and alerts. It is most commonly used for visualizing time-series data for infrastructure and application analytics but can be used in many other domains.

## Core Concepts: The Building Blocks of Grafana

Grafana's power comes from a few simple, composable concepts:

### 1. Data Sources
This is the most fundamental concept. A Data Source is any database or storage backend that Grafana can connect to and query. Grafana supports a huge number of data sources out of the box, including Prometheus, InfluxDB, Loki, Elasticsearch, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and many more. You simply tell Grafana where your data lives.

### 2. Dashboards
A Dashboard is a collection of one or more Panels, arranged in a grid. It's the canvas where you bring together different visualizations to get a high-level overview of a system or application.

### 3. Panels
A Panel is the basic visualization building block. Each panel displays data from a specific query against a data source. Grafana offers a wide variety of panels, including Time series graphs, tables, heatmaps, single stats, gauges, and many more.

### 4. Queries
Inside each panel is a query. The query defines what data you want to visualize. The syntax of the query depends on the data source you have selected for that panel (e.g., you would write a PromQL query for a Prometheus data source, or SQL for a PostgreSQL data source).

### 5. Alerting
Grafana allows you to define alerts based on the results of your queries. You can set a threshold on a panel, and if the data crosses that threshold, Grafana can send notifications to various channels like Slack, PagerDuty, email, and more.

## Why Use Grafana?

* **Unified Visualization:** Bring data from dozens of different data sources together into a single, unified dashboard. For example, you can have a graph of application metrics from Prometheus right next to a table of logs from Loki.
* **Beautiful & Flexible Dashboards:** Create rich, dynamic, and aesthetically pleasing dashboards that are easy to understand and share.
* **Open Source & Strong Community:** It has a vibrant open-source community that contributes new plugins, dashboards, and features. There is a massive library of community-built dashboards you can import and adapt.
* **Extensible via Plugins:** The functionality of Grafana can be extended with hundreds of plugins that add new data sources, panels, and applications.

## Getting Started: A Conceptual Example

Setting up a Grafana dashboard involves a clear workflow:

1.  **Install and Run Grafana:** Set up the Grafana server. This can be done via Docker, a direct binary install, or using the Grafana Cloud SaaS offering.
2.  **Add a Data Source:** Log in to the Grafana web UI. The first step is to configure a data source by telling Grafana the type of database you have and how to connect to it (e.g., the URL for your Prometheus server).
3.  **Create a Dashboard:** Create a new, empty dashboard.
4.  **Add a Panel:** Add your first panel to the dashboard.
5.  **Configure the Query:** In the panel editor, select the data source you just created and write a query to fetch the data you want to see. As you type, the panel will update in real-time.
6.  **Customize the Visualization:** Use the panel's options to customize its appearanceâ€”change colors, set units, modify axes, and more.
7.  **Save and Share:** Save the dashboard, and now you and your team can use it to monitor your system.
