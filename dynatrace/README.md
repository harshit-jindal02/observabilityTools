# Dynatrace: An Introduction

![Dynatrace Logo](https://www.dynatrace.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/dynatrace-logo-stacked-2c-pos-1.svg)

Welcome to Dynatrace! This guide is designed for those new to the platform, providing a clear overview of what Dynatrace is, its unique approach to observability, and how its powerful automation and AI capabilities set it apart.

## What is Dynatrace?

**Dynatrace is a software intelligence platform that uses artificial intelligence (AI) and automation to monitor and manage the performance and availability of software applications and the underlying IT infrastructure.**

At its heart, Dynatrace is an all-in-one platform designed for modern, dynamic cloud environments. It goes beyond simply presenting data and dashboards; its core mission is to provide precise, AI-powered answers about performance problems, their impact, and their root cause, often without any human intervention.

## Core Concepts: The Dynatrace Difference

Dynatrace's architecture is built on a few unique and powerful concepts that enable its high degree of automation.

### 1. OneAgent®
This is the cornerstone of the Dynatrace platform. Instead of deploying multiple agents for different purposes (metrics, traces, logs), you install a single **OneAgent** on a host. This one agent automatically discovers every process, application, service, and dependency on that host. It then automatically instruments them to collect all relevant observability data—metrics, traces, logs, and even real user data—with zero manual configuration.

### 2. Davis® AI Engine
Davis is the causal AI engine at the core of Dynatrace. It processes the billions of data points collected by OneAgent in real-time. Unlike correlation-based systems that just show you what happened at the same time, Davis understands the cause-and-effect relationships between all components and provides a single, precise root-cause analysis for any detected problem. It tells you *what* the problem is, *who* is impacted, and *why* it happened.

### 3. PurePath®
This is Dynatrace's patented distributed tracing technology. PurePath captures timing and code-level context for every transaction across every tier of your application stack. This provides end-to-end visibility for every single request, from the user's click in a browser down to the database query and back.

### 4. Smartscape®
Smartscape is a fully dynamic, real-time visualization of your entire technology stack. It shows all your applications, services, processes, hosts, and their interdependencies. It's not a static map; it updates in real-time as your environment changes (e.g., as containers are created or destroyed). Davis uses this map to understand problem blast radius and perform its root-cause analysis.

## Why Use Dynatrace?

* **Automatic and Intelligent:** The combination of OneAgent and Davis provides unparalleled automation, from deployment and discovery to problem analysis. This drastically reduces manual effort.
* **Causation, Not Correlation:** Dynatrace provides answers, not just data. The Davis AI pinpoints the precise root cause of issues, eliminating guesswork and alert fatigue.
* **All-in-One Platform:** It unifies infrastructure monitoring, APM, digital experience monitoring (RUM), and business analytics in a single solution.
* **Built for Cloud-Native:** It excels in highly dynamic environments like Kubernetes, microservices, and serverless, where manual configuration is impossible.

## Key Components of Dynatrace

1.  **The Dynatrace OneAgent:** The single, intelligent agent installed on each host to automatically collect all observability data.
2.  **The Dynatrace Platform:** The central brain where data is stored, processed by the Davis AI, and visualized. This can be a SaaS solution hosted by Dynatrace or a managed deployment in your own data center.

## Getting Started: A Conceptual Example

Getting started with Dynatrace is designed to be extremely simple due to its automation.

1.  **Create a Dynatrace Account:** Sign up for a free trial on the Dynatrace website.
2.  **Install OneAgent:** In the Dynatrace UI, navigate to the "Deploy Dynatrace" section. You'll be given a single command to copy and paste into your host's terminal.

    ```bash
    # Conceptual example for Linux
    wget -O Dynatrace-OneAgent-Linux.sh "YOUR_UNIQUE_TENANT_URL/api/v1/deployment/installer/agent/unix/default/latest?Api-Token=YOUR_API_TOKEN"
    sudo /bin/sh Dynatrace-OneAgent-Linux.sh
    ```

3.  **Watch the Magic Happen:** Once the command is run, OneAgent handles everything else. It will automatically detect all running processes and start sending data to the Dynatrace platform. Within minutes, you'll see your hosts, services, and applications appear in Smartscape.
4.  **Explore Answers:** Instead of building dashboards from scratch, you can immediately start looking at the automatically discovered services. If a problem occurs, Davis will generate a "Problem" ticket with a full root-cause analysis.
