# Jaeger: An Introduction

![Jaeger Logo](https://www.jaegertracing.io/img/jaeger-logo-color.svg)

Welcome to Jaeger! If you're working with microservices or other distributed systems and need to understand how requests flow through them, this guide is for you. It provides a clear overview of what Jaeger is, its core concepts, and how it helps you trace transactions from end to end.

## What is Jaeger?

**Jaeger is an open-source, end-to-end distributed tracing system.** It helps you monitor and troubleshoot transactions in complex distributed systems. Developed by Uber and now a graduated project of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), Jaeger is a standard tool for implementing observability in a microservices architecture.

It allows you to follow the entire path of a requestâ€”from the initial web request, through multiple backend services and databases, and back to the user. This visibility is crucial for debugging and performance analysis.

## Core Concepts: The Language of Tracing

Jaeger's model is based on the OpenTracing and OpenTelemetry standards.

### 1. Trace
A **Trace** represents the entire journey of a single request through your system. It's a collection of all the operations that were performed to fulfill that request.

### 2. Span
A **Span** is the primary building block of a trace. It represents a single logical unit of work within the system, such as an HTTP call to another service, a database query, or a specific function execution. Each span has a name, a start time, and a duration. Spans can be nested to form a parent-child relationship, showing the flow of execution. A trace is essentially a graph (specifically, a Directed Acyclic Graph) of spans.

### 3. Span Context
This is the metadata that travels with a request as it moves between services. The **Span Context** includes the Trace ID, the current Span ID, and other data (called "baggage") that allows Jaeger to connect all the individual spans into a single, cohesive trace.

## Why Use Jaeger?

* **Root Cause Analysis:** When an error occurs, a trace shows you exactly which service and operation failed, along with contextual logs and tags, dramatically speeding up debugging.
* **Performance and Latency Optimization:** Jaeger's UI visualizes the duration of every part of a request, making it easy to spot bottlenecks and slow operations.
* **Service Dependency Analysis:** The trace data can be used to generate a real-time service dependency graph, helping you understand how your microservices interact.
* **Distributed Context Propagation:** It provides a clear mechanism for passing contextual information between services, which is essential for consistent logging and analysis.

## Key Components of the Jaeger Architecture

1.  **Jaeger Client (SDKs):** These are language-specific libraries that you embed in your applications. They use the OpenTelemetry or OpenTracing APIs to create spans and send them to the Jaeger backend.
2.  **Jaeger Agent:** A network daemon that listens for spans sent from the clients over UDP. It batches them and sends them to the Collector. It's typically deployed on the same host as the application, acting as a sidecar.
3.  **Jaeger Collector:** The Collector receives traces from the agents, validates them, enriches them, and saves them to a storage backend.
4.  **Storage Backend:** A database where the trace data is persisted. Jaeger has pluggable storage and supports Cassandra, Elasticsearch, and other databases.
5.  **Jaeger Query & UI:** This component retrieves traces from the storage backend and provides a web UI where you can search for, visualize, and analyze your traces.

## Getting Started: A Conceptual Example

Getting started with Jaeger involves instrumenting your code and running the Jaeger backend.

1.  **Run Jaeger Backend:** The easiest way to start is by running the "all-in-one" Docker image provided by Jaeger. This single image contains the Agent, Collector, Query Service, and UI, along with in-memory storage for testing.

    ```bash
    docker run -d --name jaeger \
      -e COLLECTOR_ZIPKIN_HOST_PORT=:9411 \
      -p 5775:5775/udp \
      -p 6831:6831/udp \
      -p 6832:6832/udp \
      -p 5778:5778 \
      -p 16686:16686 \
      -p 14268:14268 \
      -p 14250:14250 \
      -p 9411:9411 \
      jaegertracing/all-in-one:latest
    ```
2.  **Instrument Your Application:** Add the Jaeger client library for your language (e.g., for Python, `pip install opentelemetry-exporter-jaeger`).
3.  **Configure the Client:** In your application's code, configure the tracer to send spans to the Jaeger Agent's default UDP port.
4.  **Create Spans:** Wrap your application's key operations with spans to measure their duration and add relevant tags or logs.
5.  **Visualize Traces:** Make a few requests to your application, then open the Jaeger UI in your browser (typically at `http://localhost:16686`). You'll be able to select your service and see the traces you've generated.
